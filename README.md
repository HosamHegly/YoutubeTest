YouTube QA Automation with Selenium
Overview
This project aims to automate quality assurance (QA) testing for YouTube, focusing on the main page, search results page, and videos page. Using Selenium WebDriver, we've developed a suite of tests to ensure these pages load correctly, function as expected, and provide a seamless user experience.

Features
Main Page Testing: Validates the presence of key elements and responsiveness of the main page.
Search Results Page Testing: Ensures search functionality returns results and allows navigation through result pages.
Videos Page Testing: Confirms video playback functions, including play/pause, volume control, and quality settings.
