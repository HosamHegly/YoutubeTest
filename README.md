# YouTube QA Automation with Selenium

## Overview
This project aims to automate quality assurance (QA) testing for YouTube, focusing on the main page, search results page, and videos page. Using Selenium WebDriver, we've developed a suite of tests to ensure these pages load correctly, function as expected, and provide a seamless user experience.

## Features
Main Page Testing: Validates the presence of key elements and responsiveness of the main page.
Search Results Page Testing: Ensures search functionality returns results and allows navigation through result pages.
Videos Page Testing: Confirms video playback functions.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Selenium WebDriver
A web driver compatible with your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)
